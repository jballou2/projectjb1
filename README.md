#problems
i faced a fair amount of problems while i was coding my project 1 python code
the first problem was my ArtistID parameters. I was getting a keyError in my 'tracks' parameters but that was a quick fix due to me leaving ou the commas because it is a list. i also left of the country in my parameters.

the second problem i faced was my dotenv not being recognizable for some reason but to resolve that i had to upgrade my dontenv with pip3, that took most of my time as i was debugging the whole time.

my third problem was my css not being connected through my html. i just had to make sure my files were in the right place, like my css file being in a static folder and having the ../static/syle.css line of code

my existing  problem i face now is my audio not playing, I am not sure why it is not playing i believe my implementation of the line of code is off

i would like to improve on my html/css skills for they are lacking. my time management on how much coding to do each day played a role too. i could have worked on more at a time each day instead of cramming.
